# RailEase

RailEase is a lightweight, responsive web application to search, view and book train journeys. It provides an intuitive UI to find trains, check PNR status, manage bookings and make payments. The app is built with modern front-end tooling and is designed for easy local development and deployment.


## Project description

RailEase is intended as a simple demo/portfolio application that simulates the core flows of a train booking app: search trains, view details, book tickets, check PNR status and view/manage your bookings. It focuses on a pleasant UI and clear developer experience rather than being a production-grade reservation system.

## How it works

- The UI components live in `src/Components` and page views are in `src/Views`.
- `main.jsx` boots the app and mounts the routes and global styles.
- The app uses client-side routing to navigate between pages (Home, Search Results, Booking, My Bookings, PNR Status, Payment, Login, About).
- For demo purposes the app may use mock data or a simple API. If the project uses a real backend, update the `.env` or API base URL in the appropriate service file.

## Usage

- Search for trains on the Home page and view results on the Search Results page.
- Click a train card to go to the Booking flow.
- Complete booking details and proceed to Payment.
- View your bookings on the My Bookings page. PNR status can be checked via the PNR Status page.
- Login is available to save and manage bookings (behavior depends on whether a backend/auth system is present).


## Tech stack

- Vite (dev server and build)
- React (JSX) for UI
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Optional: any state management or backend service as needed
